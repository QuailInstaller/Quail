Our goal is to make deploying and updating desktop applications as simple as possible

Today you can deploy a simple solution in less than 10 lines

## Current features

* Install and uninstall an application on Windows and Linux (launch shortcut / uninstall registery)
* Decompress or download a solution
* Scriptable actions
* Standalone executable


## Short time goals
* Building a versionning server
* Using quail to update solutions which alerady have an installer *.msi / *.deb / setup.exe / *.rpm  files
* Options to suggest or force updates at launch
* Integrity verification and updating only modified data
* Scriptable GUI (for install, update, uninstall)

## Long time goals
* Built in cross platform dependency management
